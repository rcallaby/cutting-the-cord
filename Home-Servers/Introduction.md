# Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Home Media Server

## Introduction
Streaming services like Netflix, Paramount+, and Disney+ provide convenient access to movies and TV shows, but they come with monthly fees, content restrictions, and licensing changes. By setting up your own home media server, you can store and stream your own collection of movies, TV shows, music, and photos without relying on third-party services. This guide will walk you through the entire process.

## 1. Choosing the Right Hardware
### **A. Server Hardware Options**
You will need a computer or dedicated server to host your media library. Here are some options:
- **Old PC or Laptop:** Repurpose an old device with sufficient storage.
- **Network Attached Storage (NAS):** Devices like Synology or QNAP provide an easy, power-efficient option.
- **Raspberry Pi:** A budget-friendly choice for smaller libraries.
- **Custom-built Home Server:** Ideal for large media collections with powerful CPU and storage.
- **Dedicated Mini PC (e.g., Intel NUC):** Compact and efficient, great for running 24/7.

### **B. Storage Considerations**
- **HDD vs SSD:** Use HDDs for bulk storage and SSDs for the operating system to improve performance.
- **RAID Configuration:** RAID 1 (mirroring) or RAID 5 (parity) can provide redundancy.
- **External USB Drives:** Cost-effective for expanding storage.

- Automatic metadata fetching
- Works on almost all platforms (Roku, Fire Stick, Apple TV, etc.)

### **B. Jellyfin (Open-Source Alternative to Plex)**
- No subscription required
- Privacy-focused with no data tracking
- Great for in-home streaming

### **C. Emby**
- Hybrid between Plex and Jellyfin
- Offers more customization than Plex
- Free for in-home use, requires a subscription for advanced features

### **D. Kodi**
- Best for a local media center setup
- Supports various plugins for extended functionality
- Can integrate with Plex or Jellyfin

## 3. Setting Up the Media Server
### **A. Installing the Operating System**
- **Windows:** Simple to manage but consumes more resources.
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):** Lightweight and stable for server use.
- **Unraid:** Excellent for NAS setups.
- **TrueNAS:** Great for dedicated NAS storage.
- **Docker:** Run Plex/Jellyfin in isolated containers.

### **B. Installing Media Server Software**
1. **Plex Example (Linux)**
   ```bash
   curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add -
   echo "deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install plexmediaserver
   ```
2. **Jellyfin Example (Linux)**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install jellyfin
   ```
3. **Setting Up Libraries**
   - Add directories for Movies, TV Shows, Music, and Photos.
   - Set metadata fetching and library refresh options.

## 4. Organizing and Importing Media
### **A. File Naming Conventions**
To ensure proper metadata fetching:
- **Movies:** `Movie Name (Year)/Movie Name (Year).ext`
- **TV Shows:** `Show Name/Season XX/Show Name - SXXEYY.ext`
- **Music:** `Artist/Album/Song.ext`

### **B. Metadata and Subtitles**
- Use **MediaElch** or **tinyMediaManager** for organizing metadata.
- Fetch subtitles automatically with **OpenSubtitles** or **Bazarr**.

### **C. Automating Media Downloads**
- **Sonarr** (TV Shows), **Radarr** (Movies), **Lidarr** (Music) for automated downloading.
- **qBittorrent** or **Transmission** for torrent management.

- **Smart TVs & Streaming Devices:** Install the Plex, Jellyfin, or Kodi app.
- **Web Browsers:** Access via `http://your-server-ip:32400/web` (Plex) or `http://your-server-ip:8096` (Jellyfin).
- **Mobile Apps:** Available for iOS and Android.
- **Game Consoles:** Plex is available for PlayStation and Xbox.

### **B. Remote Access (Optional)**
- **Plex Pass:** Allows streaming outside of your home network.
