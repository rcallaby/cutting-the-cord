# Creating Home Servers using Mini-Racks

There is a trend of using mini-racks for the home user or those studying for a job in networking or information security. This is just the beginning of a guide on how to set up a mini rack for such use cases.


## Equipment Used in Jeff Geerling's Mini-Rack Project  
Based on the mini-rack project, the key equipment used includes:  

1. **Mini Rack Chassis** – A small, portable rack (like a 6U or 9U rack) for mounting hardware.  
2. **Compact Servers/Nodes** – Small form factor servers or Raspberry Pis for computing tasks.  
3. **Network Switch** – Managed or unmanaged gigabit network switch for interconnecting devices.  
4. **Storage Devices** – NAS units or self-built storage servers.  
5. **Power Distribution Unit (PDU)** – Provides power to all devices from a single source.  
6. **Cooling Solutions** – Active cooling like rack-mounted fans.  
7. **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** – Provides backup power to the rack.  
8. **Cable Management Accessories** – Velcro ties, rack rails, and patch panels.

### Guidelines for Building a Mini-Rack Home Lab  
1. **Size Consideration** – Choose a small, portable rack (6U-12U) if you plan to move it frequently.  
2. **Power Efficiency** – Opt for energy-efficient devices like Intel NUCs, Raspberry Pis, or ARM-based servers.  
3. **Networking** – Use a managed switch for VLAN management, remote access, and network isolation.  
4. **Storage** – Consider NAS units (like Synology) or build your own with TrueNAS or Unraid.  
5. **Redundancy** – Install a UPS to protect against power outages and data loss.  
6. **Expandability** – Use a rack that allows easy expansion in the future.  
7. **Noise Reduction** – Look for low-noise cooling options and SSDs for quieter operation.
