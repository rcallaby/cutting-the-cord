I'll break down a comprehensive list for building a home lab that can serve as both a **home media center** and a **future project lab**. This setup will cover:  

- **Server hardware for virtualization/lab testing**  
- **Storage for media/NAS (Network Attached Storage)**  
- **Networking gear (switches, routers, etc.)**  
- **Rack options (mid-sized or mini)**  
- **Power management**  

Give me a moment to put together the most balanced and practical solution for your needs.

### **Server Hardware (for Virtualization/Home Lab)**

**1. Primary Server (Virtualization + Lab)**  
- **Option 1:** **Dell PowerEdge R720 or R730** (Used/Refurbished)  
   - Dual Xeon Processors  
   - 128-256GB RAM  
   - RAID Controller (for VM redundancy)  
   - Good for Proxmox, VMware ESXi, Docker, or Kubernetes.  

- **Option 2:** **HP ProLiant DL380 Gen9 or Gen10** (Used/Refurbished)  
   - Dual Xeon Processors  
   - 64-256GB RAM  
   - Similar use cases as the Dell PowerEdge.  

- **Option 3 (Power-efficient):** **Intel NUC 11/12 or HP EliteDesk Mini**  
   - Intel Core i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9  
   - 64GB RAM max  
   - Lower power usage but less scalability. Great for Docker, Plex, Home Assistant, etc.

### **Storage (NAS + Media Center Storage)**

**1. Network Attached Storage (NAS)**  
- **Option 1:** **Synology DS923+ (4-bay) or DS1522+ (5-bay)**  
   - Plex Media Server, Time Machine backups, cloud syncing, NVR for home security.  
   - Supports up to 108TB with large drives.  

- **Option 2:** **TrueNAS Scale (DIY Solution)**  
   - Build a NAS using old hardware or a custom build.  
   - ZFS for data protection, Plex, Docker, and VM hosting.  
   - Recommended build:  
     - Intel Xeon E5 or Ryzen 7 processor  
     - 64GB ECC RAM  
     - At least 4x 12TB HDD + 2x SSD for caching.  

- **HDD Recommendations:**  
   - **Seagate IronWolf Pro 12TB+** (for high durability)  
   - **Western Digital Red Plus 12TB+**

### **Networking Equipment**

**1. Router (Core Router for Network Segmentation)**  
- **Option 1:** **Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro (UDM-Pro)**  
   - All-in-one firewall, VLAN, and IDS/IPS.  
   - Easy to manage via web GUI.  
   - 1 Gbps+ throughput for your home network.  

- **Option 2:** **pfSense Firewall (DIY)**  
   - Install pfSense on a small server or Protectli Vault.  
   - VLAN segmentation, Firewall, VPN, etc.  

---

**2. Network Switch (24-48 ports)**  
- **Option 1:** **Ubiquiti USW-24 Pro (Managed)**  
   - Managed Layer 2+ switch.  
   - Great for VLAN management, access control, etc.  

- **Option 2:** **Netgear GS324TP** (Managed)  
   - Affordable managed switch.  
   - PoE+ for cameras, access points, etc.  

---

**3. Wireless Access Points (Wi-Fi)**  
- **Option 1:** **Ubiquiti UniFi 6 Pro** (Wi-Fi 6)  
   - PoE-powered, centrally managed.  
   - Great for home-wide coverage.  

- **Option 2:** **TP-Link Omada EAP670**  
   - Similar to Ubiquiti, but more affordable.

### **Rack Options (Mid-Size or Mini)**

**1. Mini Rack (Small Setup)**  
- **Option:** **StarTech 12U Server Rack**  
   - Fits a couple of rack servers, NAS, and networking gear.  
   - Great if space is limited.  

- **Option:** **Navepoint 15U Wall Mount Rack**  
   - Wall-mounted with locking doors.  
   - Ideal for small labs with organized cables.  

---

**2. Mid-Sized Rack (Scalable Setup)**  
- **Option:** **StarTech 25U Rack with Locking Door**  
   - Ideal for a large NAS, server, and networking gear.  
   - Great airflow and cable management.  

- **Option:** **Tripp Lite 42U Rack Enclosure**  
   - Full-size data center-style rack if you plan to scale massively.  
   - Allows for full power management, cooling, and scalability.  

---

### **Power Management & Cooling**

**1. Rack-Mount PDU (Power Distribution Unit)**  
- **Tripp Lite 1U PDU**  
   - Distributes power to your servers and NAS.  
   - Can support 12+ devices.  

**2. UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)**  
- **APC 1500VA Smart UPS**  
   - Provides battery backup for 20-30 minutes during power outages.  
   - Prevents hardware damage.  

---

### **Media Center Configuration (Plex, Emby, Jellyfin)**

- **Server:** Use the NAS (TrueNAS, Synology, or Unraid).  
- **Media Software:**  
   - **Plex Media Server** (Most Popular)  
   - **Jellyfin** (Open Source, Free)  
   - **Emby** (Paid, but customizable)  
- **Transcoding Support:**  
   - Install an NVIDIA GPU (like RTX 3060) in your server for hardware transcoding.

### **Future-Proofing Notes**
- Start with **one primary server** (Proxmox or ESXi) and build virtual machines for:  
   - **Active Directory**  
   - **Kali Linux** (for penetration testing labs)  
   - **Windows Server 2022** (for enterprise-level testing)  
   - **Docker/Kubernetes** (for containerized services like PiHole, Plex, etc.)  
- Use the NAS for long-term storage, media, and backups.
